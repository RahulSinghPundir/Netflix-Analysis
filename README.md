ðŸ“Š Netflix Analysis with Tableau ðŸ“ˆ

I conducted a comprehensive analysis of Netflix shows using Tableau for data visualization. The results are quite intriguing:

1. Netflix takes the lead with an extensive collection of TV-MA rated shows, surpassing all other rating categories.

2. The majority of Netflix shows hail from the United States and India, underlining the platform's global reach.

3. Documentaries shine as the most highly rated category, boasting a significant number of shows rated at 10 - a testament to their popularity among viewers.

4. An interesting correlation emerged: as the number of movies on Netflix increases, so does the availability of TV shows. This suggests a dynamic and expanding content library.

5. In the year 2018, Netflix went above and beyond by producing an impressive 1000+ shows, showcasing their dedication to content creation and expansion.

These insights provide valuable glimpses into Netflix's content landscape and its strategies for catering to a diverse global audience. If you're keen to discuss these findings or delve deeper into the dynamics of the streaming industry, please don't hesitate to reach out.
